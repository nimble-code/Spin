<H2><TT>0. Overview</TT></H2>This readme file contains the guidelines for
downloading and installing Spin and related software on Unix/Linux and Windows
platforms. Refer to <A href="http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html">Spin's
homepage</A> for a general description of Spin, with pointers to <A
href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/index.html">manual pages</A>, tutorials,
introductory papers, books, etc.
<p>
Spin is distributed freely in source form to encourage research in formal
verification, and to help a support friendly and open exchange of algorithms,
ideas, and tools.
<ul>
<h3><tt>Copyright and License</tt></h3>
The original version of the Spin source code was developed by Gerard Holzmann
at Bell Laboratories between 1980 and 1990. It was first publically released
in January 1991, initially through the Netlib source code repository.
It has been distributed freely since then for research and educational purposes,
without any guarantee of any kind expressed or implied.
On 30 December 2015 Alcatel-Lucent (the company that inherited Bell Laboratories
from AT&T in the trivestiture from 1996) transfered the copyright to all sources
to Gerard Holzmann, explicitly to enable a standard open source release
under the BSD 3-Clause license. Starting with Spin Version 6.4.5 all Spin code,
sources and executables, are now available under the BSD 3-Clause license.
<p>
Spin is also part of the stable release of Debian, and is starting to show up
in newer Ubuntu releases (16.10+), so that you'll soon be able to install it with
a standard <em>sudo apt-get install spin</em> command.
<p>
From the early development of the Plan9 Operating System, Spin has also been
part of that distribution and versions can be found, for instance, in the
version distributed by UC Berkeley.
</ul>

<H2><TT><A name=S2>1. Downloading Spin</A></TT></H2>Spin runs on Unix,
Solaris, and Linux machines, on most flavors of Windows PCs, and on Macs.
Precompiled binary executables for some popular types of machines are available
in the
<A href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html">Spin Binaries</A>.
<p>
All binaries have an extension that matches the Spin version number,
such as <tt>spin649.exe</tt>. To install the binary, rename it to
<tt>spin.exe</tt> and copy it into your bin directory.
<p>
If you have machine type that is not available there, or if you are
installing Spin for the first time, then follow the more detailed instructions
below.

System</A></FONT></TT></H2>
<ul>Place the *.tar.gz file from the <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/index.html">Spin Source Distribution</A> in
  clean directory, and cd to that directory. If you have a standard Unix/Linux system,
  unpack the archive, and compile an executable, for instance as follows: <pre>	gunzip *.tar.gz
	tar -xf *.tar
	cd Src*
	make
</pre>
  <p>If you are on a SOLARIS system, edit the makefile and add
  <TT>-DSOLARIS</TT> to the compiler directives in the makefile before you type
  'make'. Similarly, if you use a different C compiler than defined in the
  makefile, edit the makefile first. You need to have at least a C compiler and
  a copy of yacc.
  <p>If all else fails, you can also compile everything with the following line:
<pre>	yacc -v -d spin.y; cc -o spin *.c
</pre>
  <p>Spin should compile without warnings. Install the executable version of
  spin in a directory that is within your default search path (such as your home
  bin directory, or /usr/local/bin etc.)
  <p>
  On Unix/Linux systems Spin assumes that the standard C preprocessor cpp is
  stored in file "/lib/cpp". On some systems this is different: check the
  comments in the makefile for details if you run into this problem.

  <H3><TT>Testing</TT></H3>To test the basic sanity of the Spin executable, or
  to get familiar with the basic usage of Spin, cd
  to the Examples directory that was created when you unpacked the source archive,
  and follow the instructions in README.tests file that is included there.

  <H3><TT>Adding iSpin (Unix/Linux)</TT></H3>iSpin is an optional, but highly
  recommended, graphical user interface to Spin, written in Tcl/Tk. To obtain
  Tcl/Tk, see <A href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html#S3">Related
  software</A>. The iSpin source can be found the iSpin/ subdirectory that will
  is created when you unpack the source tarfile.
  <p>iSpin is compatible with Tcl/Tk version 8.4 and 8.5.
  <p>iSpin prints the version numbers of Spin, iSpin, and Tcl/Tk when it starts
  up. You can also check separately which version of Tcl/Tk you have installed
  by executing the following commands in `wish' (a Tcl/Tk command): 
<pre>	info tclversion
	puts $tk_version
</pre>You can find out which version of Spin you have by typing, at a shell
  command prompt: <pre>	$ spin -V
</pre>
  Spin and iSpin need a working version of a C compiler installed on your system.
  <p>iSpin can also make use the graph layout program 'dot' if it is available
  on your system. For information on 'dot,' see <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html#S3">Related software</A>.
  <p>To install iSpin run the iSpin/install.sh script (after possibly editing it).
  <ul>
    <LI>invoke the program by typing<pre>	ispin
or
	ispin promela_spec

For example:
	ispin Spin/Examples/LTL/leader.pml
</pre></LI>
</ul>Check the online Help menus in ispin for more details on routine use.</ul>

<H2><TT><A name=S1b><FONT color=red>2b. Installing Spin on a Windows
PC</FONT></A></TT></H2>
<ul>If you just need to update the Spin executable itself, download a new
  version from <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html">http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html</A>
  If you need more files, e.g. a new copy of iSpin, download the latest
  pc_spin*.zip file from <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/index.html">http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/index.html</A>
  Extract the files from pc_spin*.zip, and copy spin*.exe, renamed spin.exe, into the directory
  where all your commands reside and that is within your default search path
  (e.g., c:/cygwin/bin/, or c:\apps\spin\) You can find out what your search
  path is set to by typing 'set' at an MS-DOS prompt -- this prints a list of
  all defined variables in your environment, including the search path that is
  used to find executable commands.
  (Note that you may need to set the search path in the environment variables)
  <p>
  If you use Spin from the command line (i.e., without iSpin), be warned that
  some command shells, e.g., the MKS Korn-shell, have none-standard rules for
  argument parsing (i.e., you can not reliably quote an argument that contains
  spaces, such as an LTL formula). In most cases this will not be much of a
  problem, except with the conversion of LTL formula with the spin -f option.
  Use single-quotes when needed, e.g.: spin -f '[]<>p'
  You can circumvent the problem by using inline LTL formula, which are supported
  in Spin version 6, or by using sping option -F instead of -f, to read the formula
  from a file instead of the command line.
  <p>
  To run Spin, also with the precompiled version, you need a working
  C-compiler and a C-preprocessor, because Spin generates its model checking
  software as C-source files that require compilation before a verification can
  be performed. This guarantees fast model checking, because each model checker
  can be optimized to the specific model being checked. Check, for instance, if
  you can compile and run a minimal C program succesfully, e.g.:
<pre>
	#include &#60;stdio.h&#62;
	int main(void) { printf("hello\n"); }
</pre>
  <p>To find a public version of a C compiler and some instructions on how to
  install it see <A href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html#S3">Related
  software</A>.

  <H3><TT>Adding iSpin (PC)</TT></H3>To run iSpin on a PC, you need the PC
  version of Tcl/Tk, which you can find under <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html#S3">Related software</A>.
  <p>The ispin*.tcl source is contained in the .zip file of the <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/index.html">distribution</A>. Copy the .tcl
  file as is into a directory where you plan to work, or put a shortcut to this
  file on the Desktop or in the Start Menu. If you keep the extension .tcl, make
  sure it is recognized as a 'wish' file by the system, so that ispin starts
  when you double click the ispin*.tcl script.
  <p>Under cygwin, copy the ispin*.tcl file to /bin/ispin and make it executable
  You can now use ispin as a normal Unix-style command,
  and you can pass the name of a filename to it, for instance as: <pre>	ispin leader
</pre>
  <p>An alternative is to start ispin from its source by invoking wish:
<pre>	wish -f ispin.tcl
  or	wish -f /bin/ispin
</pre
  (you'll have to know where the source is stored for this to work of course).
  <p>
  An even more indirect way to force ispin to startup is to first start `wish' from the
  Start Menu, under Programs, then select the larger window that comes up (the
  command window), and cd to the directory where you've stored the ispin tcl/tk source
  file. Then you can then start it up by typing: <pre>	source ispin.tcl  # or whatever else you've named this
</pre>and you should be up and running.
  <p>The PC installation assumes that you have a command called "cpp.exe" or "gcc.exe"
  available (which comes with the gnu-c installation). "cpp" is the traditional
  name of the C preprocessor. Alternatively, ispin can also use the Visual C++
  compiler, which is named cl.exe for preprocessing. To complicate your life
  somewhat, if you have a copy of the Borland C++ compiler installed, you'll
  notice that this cplusplus compiler was also named cpp.exe -- that's not the
  cpp you want. To avoid the name clash, you either have to edit the Spin source
  code to give it the full path name of the 'real' cpp.exe and recompile, or use
  Spin with the command-line option -Pxxxx where xxxx is the path for cpp.exe.
  Or better still (the current default) use gcc for both compilation and for preprocessing.
  Nothing much in Spin will work without access to a preprocessor. You can do a
  reasonable number of things without a full-blown compiler though (like simulations). The
  C-compiler (e.g., gcc) is required for all verifications and for the automata views in
  iSpin. 
<p>
  If iSpin cannot locate the gcc executable on your system, it will put up a warning
  message when it first starts up.  On recent versions of cygwin
  gcc is actually a link from /bin/gcc to /bin/gcc-3 or /bin/gcc-4
  <br>Depending on how the name changes, iSpin may not always recognize it.
  To fix this -- edit the iSpin source (it's tcl/tk text) and
  define CC as <pre>	set CC c:/cygwin/bin/gcc-5</pre> or whatever the new name is.
</p></ul>
<p>
<H2><TT><A name=S1c><FONT color=red>2c. Installing Spin on a Mac</FONT></A></TT></H2>
  <ul>
  Compile Spin from its sources, as described under 2a for Unix systems in general,
  while following the suggestions below, which were provided by
  Dominik Brettnacher, email: <tt>domi@saargate.de</tt>.
<p>
The C preprocessor on Mac OS X cannot be found in <tt>/lib</tt>.
Change the path in the makefile for the
proper location (<tt>/usr/bin/cpp</tt>), and in addition
also tell the Mac preprocessor to handle its input as
"assembler-with-cpp."
This can be done by adding a flag to cpp, for instance in
the makefile by adding the directive
<ul>
<pre>
-DCPP="\"gcc -E -x c -xassembler-with-cpp\""
</pre>
</ul>
to the definition of <tt>CFLAGS</tt>.
If you prefer <tt>clang</tt>, you can also try if the following works (not tested):
<ul>
<pre>
-DCPP="\"clang -E -x c\""
</pre>
</ul>
</pre>
<p>
<H3><TT>Adding iSpin</TT></H3>
On the Mac, iSpin is known to work correctly with Tcl/Tk Aqua,
which offers a self-contained binary distribution for the Mac.
Use, for instance, "TclTkAquaStandalone", version 8.4.4 from
<ul>
<pre><a href="http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~steffen/tcltk/TclTkAqua/">http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~steffen/tcltk/TclTkAqua/</a>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Some users reported that on a Mac
iSpin by default places its temporary files into the root directory.
This is nasty if you have admin privileges and probably leads to error
messages if you don't.
To prevent this, add a "cd" statement to iSpin (no arguments, just cd by
itself on a line), as the first command executed.
Place it, for instance, directly after the opening comments in the file.
This makes iSpin use the home directory for these files.
<p>
TclTk Aqua also provides the possibility to start a script when being run.
For instance, to make iSpin start if you launch the TCL interpreter:
move the ispin file into the "Wish Shell.app", as follows:
<ul><pre>
chmod -R u+w Wish\ Shell.app
mkdir Wish\ Shell.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts
mv ispin*.tcl Wish\ Shell.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/AppMain.tcl
</pre>
</ul>
</ul>

<HR>

<H2><TT><A name=S3>3. Related Software</A></TT></H2>
<ul>Some pointers to public domain versions of related software packages.
Some (e.g, a C compiler) are required to run Spin, but most other packages
are optional extensions or alternatives.

  <H3><TT>GCC (needed for Spin)</TT></H3>On Unix/Linux you probably have gcc, or an equivalent,
  installed. On the PC you need either a copy of Visual Studio Express (for the cl
  command), or an installation of gcc with minimally the executables: gcc.exe,
  and cpp.exe in your search path, together with all the standard C library
  routines and header files. You can get good free version of all these files
  with the <TT>cygwin</TT> toolkit, which is mostly self-installing and
  available from: <A href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</A>
  <BR>See also what's available in <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html">http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html</A>.

  <H3><TT>Tcl/Tk Wish (needed for iSpin only)</TT></H3>To run iSpin you'll need Tcl/Tk. Tcl/Tk was
  written by John Ousterhout (john.ousterhout@eng.sun.com) and is public domain.
  It can be obtained (for PCs or Unix) from cygwin, or from: <A
  href="http://www.tcl.tk/">http://www.tcl.tk/</A> or also (a more recent extension):
  <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/">
  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/</a><BR>More details can be found
  in netnews-group: comp.lang.tcl

  <H3><TT>Yacc (optional)</TT></H3>To compile Spin itself from its sources on a
  PC, you'll need to have a copy of yacc installed. A public domain version for
  a Windows PC can most easily be obtained from <b>cygwin</b>, or also from: 
<pre>	<A href="ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/byacc.tar.Z">ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/byacc.tar.Z</A>
</pre>A copy of this file is also available in: <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html">http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html</A>
  (You don't need yacc on the PC if you use the pre-compiled version of Spin
  for the pc in the pc*.zip file from the distribution) Look at the file
  make_it.bat for an example on how to perform the compilation.
<br>
  On a Unix/Linux/Ubuntu system you can install yacc in the usual way, with apt-get.

  <H3><TT>Dot (optional)</TT></H3>Dot is a graph layout tool developed by
  Stephen North and colleagues at AT&amp;T (email: north@research.att.com).
  iSpin can make use of dot to show a graph layout of the state-machines in the
  automata-view option (recommended!).
To obtain Dot, see
<pre>
	<A href="http://www.graphviz.org/">http://www.graphviz.org/</A>
</pre>
The are both PC and Unix versions of dot available. For documentation of
dot see, for instance:
<pre><I>	A technique for drawing directed graphs</I>,
	by Gansner, Koutsofios, North and Vo,
	IEEE-TSE, March, 1993.
</pre>
If you accept the default installation on a PC, you will need to define the
location of dot.exe in the ispin source as follows:
<pre>
	set DOT "C:/Program\\ Files\ATT\Graphviz/bin/dot.exe"
</pre>
(the line that sets the location of DOT appears near the top of the ispin.tcl file).

<H3><TT>Etch (optional)</TT></H3>
Etch, short for Enhanced Type CHecker, can perform more thorough static
checking than the  default SPIN type checker, using type inference to
reconstruct types of  channels which can only be incompletely specified
in Promela. The  techniques are described in a
<a href="http://spinroot.com/spin/symposia/ws05/002_paper.pdf">SPIN 2005 tool demo paper</a>.
<br>
The Etch tool can be downloaded from:

</pre>

<h3><tt>TopSpin (optional)</tt></h3>
TopSpin is a symmetry reduction package for Spin, developed by Alastair Donaldson.
It can be applied to a Promela model and, provided that the model adheres to some
restrictions (detailed in a user manual) uses computational group theory to determine
a group of component symmetries associated with the model. The tool can
modify the model checking algorithm used by Spin to exploit the symmetries during
verification, resulting in reduced memory use and in many cases also shorter verification time.
The package can be downloaded from:
<pre>
	<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~afd/topspin/">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~afd/topspin/</a>
</pre>

<H3><TT>JSpin (optional)</TT></H3>
jSpin, developed by <a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari">Moti Ben-Ari</a>, is
an alternative to the iSpin GUI written in Java instead of Tcl/Tk. It is meant as a teaching aid. See:
<pre>
	<a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/software-and-learning-materials/jspin/">http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/software-and-learning-materials/jspin/</a>
</pre>
The jSpin tool can be configured for use on Linux and Macs, and can also
run under Windows, with or without cygwin installed (e.g., with mingw).
<br>
The jSpin tool can be downloaded from github:
<pre>
	<a href="https://github.com/motib">https://github.com/motib</a>
</pre>
<H3><TT>Erigone (optional)</TT></H3>
Erigone, also developed by Moti Ben-Ari, is a reimplementation of a subset of
an early version of Spin, meant for educational use.
Erigone is written in Ada 2005 instead of C. 
Erigone can be downloaded from the github link above.

<H3><TT>SpinJa (optional)</TT></H3>
SpinJa is reimplementation of a subset of Spin in Java,
developed by Marc de Jonge at Twente University in The Netherlands.
A more detailed description of SpinJa was presented at the 2010 Spin Symposium
by Marc de Jonge and Theo Ruys.
The tool can be downloaded from:

</pre>


<H3><TT>Ltl2Ba (optional)</TT></H3>A faster method to generate very small
  never claims from LTL formulae, developed by Denis Oddoux and Paul Gastin is
  available online in source form:
<pre>
	<A href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/ltl2ba.tar.gz">http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/ltl2ba.tar.gz</A>
