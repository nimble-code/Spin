<h1><tt>SPIN VERIFIER's ROADMAP:
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">BUILDING AND VERIFYING <i>Spin</i> MODELS</font>
</tt></h1>
The following description provides a basic overview of the
verification options that can be used with the <i>Spin</i> model checker.
This description assumes that <i>Spin</i> has been installed and that you
have a standard C compiler (such as gcc) as well.
It also assumes that you are familiar with standard shell command use
on a Unix-like system (e.g., Ubuntu Linux, MAC-OS-X, or Cygwin on a Windows-PC).

<hr>
<h2><tt><font color=blue>-0-</font></tt></h2>
Verification begins with the specification of a prototype of the system
to be studied in the specification language supported by <i>Spin</i>.
This language is called ProMeLa (short for Process Meta Language),
and the model is called a <i>verification model</i>, or a <i>Spin model</i>.
	<div class="boxed">
	By convention, ProMeLa specification files have
	a <tt>.pml</tt> file extension.<p>
	</div>
Next you must consider how you can express the critical correctness requirements
for your model.
You can use assertions, end-state labels, progress-state labels,
acceptance-state labels, or LTL properties.
But don't worry, in most cases of practical interest you will
only need assertions, and less frequently simple LTL properties.
<hr>
<h2><tt><font color=blue>-1-</font></tt></h2>
For a quick checkout of the model you have just defined:
do a simulation run to catch the simpler mistakes.
<br>
If no flags are provided, <i>Spin</i> performs a random simulation
of the model.
<pre>
	$ spin spec.pml		# no options: only print statements produce output
</pre>
It is often very helpful, especially at this stage in debugging the
basic verification model, to add printf statements to the specification
to make things more clear.
<p>
You can add more options to see useful things happening.
Without additional flags, only print statements that you use in
the model will produce output. If there are none, you may want
to use some additional flags.
<pre>
	$ spin -p spec.pml	# simulation run, show all execution steps
	$ spin -c spec.pml	# columnated output for message i/o
</pre>
You can use the command:
<pre>
	$ spin --
</pre>
to see what other options are available for including additional information in
the simulation runs.
<br>
An important one, in case your model can execute forever, is the ability to
set an upper-limit on the number of execution steps performed in a simulation.
For instance, to limit the simulation to the first 200 steps:
<pre>
	$ spin -u200 -p -l -g -v spec.pml
</pre>
Check in the output of spin -- what the additional flags that are used here do.
<p>
When done debugging, you can perform a more thorough check
of your model with this command:
<pre>
	$ spin -a spec.pml		# thorough check
</pre>
This step can report
syntax errors and impurities that the simulation commands don't catch.
For feedback on possible redundancies in your specification, try also:
<pre>
	$ spin -A spec.pml		# check for redundancies
</pre>
And, if you really want to get carried away, you can look at the
automata descriptions that <i>Spin</i> generates for you for the
verifier's use, by executing:
<pre>
	$ spin -search -dump spec.pml
or just
	$ spin -search -d spec.pml
</pre>
If, on the other hand you just want
to get a quick basic verification run going, use this command,
which will compile and run your verification immediately:
<pre>
	$ spin -search spec.pml
</pre>
And the rest, as they say, is just detail. We will indulge in
some of that detail in the next few points.

<hr>

<h2><tt><font color=blue>-2-</font></tt></h2>
The biggest decision to make is if the model you created is simple
enough to perform a fully exhaustive verification on the machine that
you are using. The limits, as always, are CPU-time and RAM memory.
The good news is that even if you do not have enough time or memory,
<i>Spin</i> can be configured to give you the best possible result
within the constraints that you do have. We will first consider
how you can setup a standard exhaustive verification run.
<div class="boxed">
<b><font color=blue>Exhaustive</font></b>
<br>For an exhaustive verification, you can compile the generated
verification code as follows.
<pre>
	$ spin -search -O2 spec.pml            # use optimized compilation
</pre>
It is always smart to use the <tt>-O2</tt> flag to optimize
the code: it can often reduce the runtime needed by about 50%.
<p>
If you know how much <i>physical</i> (not virtual) RAM memory your system has,
you can use this to restrict the maximum amount that a verification
can take to avoid unpleasant paging behavior, for instance,
if you have 256 Megabyte available compile as follows.
<pre>
	$ spin -search -O2 -DMEMLIM=256 spec.pml   # set memory bound at 256MB
</pre>
If the amount of memory you have is not sufficient to complete a verification,
consider using one of the compression options that <i>Spin</i> supports.
For instance:
<pre>
	$ spin -search -O2 -DMEMLIM=256 -collapse spec.pml # use compression
</pre>
or, for a still more aggressive option, try:
<pre>
	$ spin -search -O2 -DMEMLIM=256 -hc spec.pml # use hash-compact compression
</pre>
If also this is insufficient, and your verification still exceeds the memory bounds,
switch to <i>Bitstate</i> verification run (also known
as a <i>Supertrace</i> verification).
<p>
<b><font color=blue>Bitstate</font></b>
<br>For a Bitstate verification run, compile as follows.
<pre>
	$ spin -search -O2 -bitstate spec.pml    # use bitstate search
</pre>
This is often used as a method of last resort when a full
verication is infeasible because of memory limitations or problem size.
It can also be used as a fast prescan of a problem, to get an
early and quick indication of the presence or absence of errors.<p>
</div>

<hr>
<h2><tt><font color=blue>-3-</font></tt></h2>
Up to this point we have ignored what type of property you are
trying to verify, or what impact problem size may have on your
chances of performing a successful verification.
We will address these points now.

<p>
There are four more decisions you have to make to perform verifications optimally.
These four decisions are:
<ol>
<li> Selecting the type of property to be verified (safety or liveness)
<li> Selecting the maximum search depth,
<li> If you use a Bitstate search: selecting the size of the hash-table
<li> Selecting the parameters for a replay of an error, if one is found.
</ol>
We'll now explore each of these decisions in more detail.
<ol>
<p>
<li>
The first decision is to decide if you want to check the model
for <i><font color=blue>Safety</font></i> properties or for
<i><font color=blue>Liveness</font></i> properties.

	<div class="boxed">
	<b><font color=blue>Safety</font></b>
	<br>
	Examples of safety properties are assertion violations, deadlocks
	(invalid end-states), etc.
	<p>
	To check safety properties only (the most frequently used search mode),
	you can obtain a fast verifier by adding a <tt>-safety</tt> argument:
	<pre>
		$ spin -search <b>-safety</b> spec.pml</pre>
	plus of course any of the other arguments we discussed earlier, for instance:
	<pre>
		$ spin -search -O2 -bitstate -safety spec.pml</pre>
	
	In this case you can also use <i>Spin</i>'s breadth-first search mode, which
	works only for safety properties but has the advantage of finding
	the shortest possible error traces:
	<pre>
		$ spin -search <b>-bfs</b> spec.pml</pre>
	again combined with any other options you need.
	
	<p>
	<b><font color=blue>Liveness</font></b>
	<br>
	Examples of liveness properties are non-progress or acceptance cycles.
	LTL properties can express both safety and liveness properties.
	In case of doubt: assume you have a liveness property.
	<p>
	To perform a search for violations of general liveness properties
	you use the runtime parameter <tt>-a</tt> following the <tt>-search</tt> argument
	to Spin. For instance:
	<pre>
		$ spin -search <b>-a</b> spec.pml</pre>
	plus any other runtime arguments you selected.
	
	<p>
	<b><font color=blue>Non-Progress</font></b>
	<br>
	A non-progress cycle is an infinite execution that never passes
	through any state in the specification that is marked with a labelname
	that starts with the prefix <i>"progress"</i>.
	<p>
	To search for non-progress cycles you add
	run-time option <tt>-l</tt>, for instance as in:
	<pre>
		$ spin -search <b>-l</b> spec.pml</pre>
	plus any other runtime arguments you selected.<p>
	</div>

<p>
<li>
By default the <i>Spin</i> verifiers enforce a search depth restrictionof 10,000 steps.
In most cases this will suffice, but when it doesn't the search depth
will artificially be truncated to 9,999 steps and become incomplete.
You can define a different search-depth by adding a runtime parameter <tt>-m</tt>.
For instance:
<pre>
	$ spin -search <b>-m100000</b> spec.pml
</pre>
(again, combined with any other options you select).
<p>
You can also try to set a lower search depth to try to find a shorter variant
of an error sequence. For instance
<pre>
	$ spin -search -m40 spec.pml
</pre>
But in thise case there is no guarantee that if a shorter error sequence
exists it will also be found. To get that guarantee you also have to instruct
Spin to modify the search algorithm itself, with a
runtime parameter <tt>-i</tt> to force a search for a short error.
For instance, to search for errors shorter than 100 steps:
<pre>
	$ spin -search O2 <b>-i -m100</b> spec.pml	# iterative search for short errors
</pre>

<li>
If you perform a <tt>Bitstate</tt>
verification (i.e., you used the search argument <tt>-bitstate</tt>), the
size of the memory arena that is used to store states very compactly is
determined by your choice of a <tt>-w</tt> parameter. By default,
this parameter is set to <tt>-w27</tt>, which defines a
memory arena of 2<sup>27</sup> bits, corresponding to a modest 16 MB of RAM.
	<div class="boxed">
	For maximum coverage you want to set the hash-array size to the maximum
	size of memory you can grab without making the system page
	(i.e., below the amount of real physical RAM memory that you can access).
	<p>
	More specifically, for maximum coverage,
	the value you set with the <tt>-w</tt> parameter should at least be larger
	than the nearest power of 2 of the number of reachable system
	states that you expect, without exceeding your physical memory size.
	(And for obvious reasons, you cannot allocate more than about 2 GB of memory
	on a 32-bit system. For larger memory arenas you will have to use a 64-bit system.)
	<p>
	For instance, use <tt>-w23</tt> if you expect less than 8 million reachable states
	and can use 8 million bits of memory (i.e., 2<sup>23</sup> bits equals
	8 million bits, which equals 2<sup>20</sup> bytes or 1 MB of RAM).<p>
	<p>
	A <tt>-w</tt> value lower than required for full coverage will give you a faster
	run, but less coverage.  A value higher than needed, will give you
	a slower run, but it will also cover a larger fraction of the statespace.
	</div>

<p>
<li>
If the verifier finds an error, any error, it will write an error-trail into a
file named <tt>spec.pml.trail</tt>, if <tt>spec.pml</tt> is the name of
your <i>Spin</i> model.
To inspect the trail, and examine the cause of the error,
you can use <i>Spin</i>'s guided simulation option <b>-replay</b>.
<br>
For instance:
<pre>
	$ spin -p -replay spec.pml
or
	$ spin -c -replay spec.pml
</pre>

	<div class="boxed">
	Note that options to spin like <tt>-p</tt> and <tt>-c</tt>
	go <i>before</i> the <tt>-replay</tt> argument.
	<br>
	If, however, a replay must be done with the executable verifier
	<tt>./pan</tt>, which automatically happens for
	all models that contain embedded C code fragments in <tt>c_expr</tt>
	or <tt>c_code</tt> statements, then replay options to the executable
	verifier are placed <i>after</i> the <tt>-replay</tt> argument,
	for instance as in: <tt>spin -replay -P2 spec.pml</tt>.
	The executable verifier accepts different options for replay
	then spin itself, so it is good to keep these separate.
	<br>
	Options placed <i>after</i> the <tt>-replay</tt> argument
	for a pure Promela model, and
	options placed <i>before</i> the <tt>-replay</tt> argument
	for a model with embedded C code, are politely ignored.
	<p></div>

Add as many extra or different options as you need to pin down the error.
(Remember, you can check <i>Spin</i>'s available options 
by executing: <tt>spin --</tt>, and options of the executable verifier
with <tt>./pan --</tt>.)
One option is to convert the trail into a Tcl/Tk represetation of
a message sequence chart of send and receive actions, which will then be displayed
with the <tt>wish</tt> command (assuming <tt>wish</tt> is installed on your system):
<pre>
	$ spin -M -replay spec.pml
</pre>
For more detailed tracebacks you can use, for instance:
<pre>
	$ spin -r -s -l -g -replay spec.pml
</pre>
Make sure the file <tt>spec.pml</tt> didn't change since you generated the verifier.
<i>Spin</i> will warn if you did.
<p>
If you're not interested in the <i>first</i> error that is reported, add
runtime option <tt>-c</tt> to select others:
<pre>
	$ spin -search ... <b>-c3</b> spec.html
</pre>
generates a counter-example trail for the third error found in the search.
If you just want to count all errors and not see them, use
<pre>
	$ spin -search ... <b>-c0</b> spec.html
</pre>
By default, the argument to -c is 1.
<p>
If you want to obtain a trail for each and every error found (usually not
recommended, because there may be an overwhelming number of these), use:
<pre>
	$ spin -search ... <b>-c0 -e</b> spec.html
</pre>
This creates a series of error trails in files numbers
<tt>spec2.pml.trail</tt>, <tt>spec3.pml.trail</tt>, ...etc.
To trace back a specific one of these trails, you can specify the
specific trail file you want to see with a -k option:
<pre>
	$ spin -k trailfilename -p -replay spec.pml
</pre>
</ol>
<p>

<hr>
<h2><tt><font color=blue>Finally</font></tt></h2>
Internally <i>Spin</i> and pan deal with a formalization of
the model in terms of automata.
<i>Spin</i> assigns numbers to all statements in the input.
These state numbers are listed in all output so that you
can, if you want, use that information to track down what happens.
To see the state assignments use the runtime option -d for the
executable verifier pan:
<pre>
	$ spin -o3 -search -d spec.pml	# show optimized state machines
</pre>
to print the optimized state machine assignments, as it is used during
verification. (The <tt>-o3</tt> argument turns off a default statement
merging option that can sometimes make it harder to interpret the
output.)
<br>
The unoptimized machine (used during random or guided simulations with
spin -replay for instance) can also be printed, but you need the executable
verifier for that. (It will exist if you've executed the above command
first):
<pre>
	$ spin -o3 -search -d -d spec.pml	# show full, unoptimized state machines
</pre>
These two options should also make it easier to understand and
verify the working of <i>Spin</i> and <tt>pan</tt> in terms of
the underlying automata theoretic foundation.
<p>
In very rare cases, when you need to debug the working of the
verifier itself, you can also consider compiling the verifier with
an additional compiler directive <tt>-DCHECK</tt> or <tt>-DVERBOSE</tt>.
